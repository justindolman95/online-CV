Alongside my studies I have also been employed through various organisations in the public and private sector which compliments the expertise and knowledge I have gained through university. <br><br>
I have created this website as a means to portray my ability in front-end website creation, which has motivated me to further develop skills in this area. 
To truly develop my skills in web development, I've made this website completely from scratch - using a Microsoft Notepad document, saved as a HTML file UTF-8.
